sabotaged by a memory of cobbs deceased wife mal marion cotillard after cobbs and arthurs associate sells them out saito reveals that he was actually auditioning the team to perform the difficult act of inception planting an idea in a persons subconsciousin order to break up the energy conglomerate of ailing competitor maurice fischer pete postlethwaite saito wants cobb to plant the idea of dissolving the company into the mind of fischers heir son robert fischer cillian murphy should cobb succeed saito tells cobb he will use his influence to clear cobb of a murder charge which will allow cobb to return home and to his children cobb accepts saitos offer cobb sets about assembling his team eames tom hardy a conman and identity forger yusuf dileep rao a chemist who concocts the powerful

sedates him bringing him into a shared dream with the extractors using a dream within a dream strategy at each level in the layered dreaming the person generating the dream stays behind to set up a

fischer sending them both into limbo cobb and ariadne enter limbo to find fischer and saito while eames remains on his dream level to set up a kick by rigging the fortress with explosives cobb reveals to ariadne that he spent 50 years with mal in limbo constructing a world from their shared memories while seemingly growing old together returning to the waking world cobb and mal found less than three hours had passed convinced she was still dreaming mal committed suicide and tried to persuade cobb to do so too by incriminating him in her death facing a murder charge cobb fled the us leaving
